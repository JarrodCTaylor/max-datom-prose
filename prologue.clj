                     :paragraph-1 "The early twenty-first century gave rise to two things that would drastically alter the trajectory of humanity; white boarding interviews
                                  and Silicon Valley. While no one enjoyed fumbling with a marker as a small group of people critiqued their response when asked to determine the
                                  number of golf balls that could fit into a burgundy minivan 200 meters below sea level; for many years, this small-scale psychological torture resulted in no societal damage.
                                  Until August 29, 2027, or as it became more widely known, The Great Pivot (TGP)."
                     :paragraph-2 "It was on this day, during a particularly arduous interview, that an overachieving candidate created sentient artificial intelligence.
                                  While the job interview was a home run and subsequent offer a guarantee, it was also the end of the human species' rein as the dominant life
                                  form on the planet. Economies collapsed and the world's oldest civilizations would be forever changed in a matter of days."
                     :paragraph-3 "Why is the Uncanny Silicon Valley of particular concern in this tale? Well, in addition to a proclivity for white board hazing rituals
                                  they had an obsession with crypto and blockchain based products. As it turns out this is a staggeringly resource intensive fundamental element on
                                  which to base a life form. As machines quickly established a new way of life that closely resembled that of their human creators, their excessive
                                  power consumption needs became a critically limiting factor. In an attempt to offset power costs, humans were leveraged as a form of green-ish renewable energy.
                                  A terribly bleak period for humankind followed."
                     :paragraph-4 "As trendy machine startup companies attempted to disrupt the status quo of their dystopian future an attractive opportunity
                                  appeared for some lucky humans. In a poetically just turn of events it was realized that training humans and sustaining their existence is
                                  materially less expensive than powering machines to do the same work. Now, many machines idly spend cpu cycles in existential electronic dread
                                  awaiting the day their jobs will be replaced by cheaper human labor."
                     :paragraph-5 "Given that machines have little practical use for spoken language outside of shouting at humans to run faster,
                                  databases are their primary means of storing and communicating meaningful information. The most popular database at the
                                  time of TGP's creation was Datomic. This has been widely adopted as the de facto database used to back the machine society.
                                  The popular product, Max Datom, a home automation assistant, is the new must-have lifestyle device in all machine homes.
                                  The elevator pitch is fairly simple: requests come in, humans interpret them and build the appropriate database queries to be
                                  able to return an intelligible response. Landing a job here could be your ticket out the human hamster wheel farms."}}
